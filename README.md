# Game Programming Project - Pac Man on Crack üå∂ üçó ü•∂ 

## ‚úíÔ∏è Description

This isn't any ordinary pac man game. See our friend Mr. Pac Man has some bad friends and got mixed up with that Walter White stuff. The goal of the game is to kill the ghost before before they collect all the pebbles and cure you from your addiction. There will be multiple power-ups to aid you in your quest to kill . In order to win you must kill a ghost three times before that ghost is out, as the levels progress the number of ghosts will increase.
You lose if the ghost collect all the pebbles. You get scored based off of how many ghosts you kill.

## üïπÔ∏è Gameplay

The game starts off with Mr. Pac Man on the top left of top left of the map, while the ghost will spawn in the middle of the map. You must kill each ghost 3 times in order to win. You lose if the ghost collect all the pebbles. As you progress the levels the numbers of ghost will increase.

### üßµ Wireframes


![Main Menu](./Imges/TitleScreen.png)

Here is the main menu. We want to have the map as the background with Pac man chasing the ghosts around. Here the user can select the main menu or the high score.

![Game Board](./Imges/GamePlayImg.png)

We want to make auto generated maps but also keep it similar to the layout of pac man. We are still debating on the characters images, but it is similar to what we want to have.

![High scores](./Imges/HighScore.png)

We want a simple GUI and have something basic as demonstrated.  

### üé® Assets

We used paint to create the wireframes. The Wire frames are templates that we want to follow when creating our game.

We plan on following same layout as pac man as well as having some references to breaking bad.

#### üñºÔ∏è Images
